<p><strong>Pastoral Memories and the Origins of the Countryside Landscape</strong></p>

<p>The Santa Clara Valley's rich alluvial soils and Mediterranean
climate made it an ideal location for farming. Spanish missionaries
established the Valley's early agricultural presence in the 1700s, and
until the 1960s agriculture remained the dominant economic activity of
the valley. The history of the farms, ranches, and orchards that once
covered the valley's floor faded from the physical landscape, but
emerged as a popular memory on the imagined landscape.</p>

<p><strong>A Home in the Countryside</strong></p>
<p>The memory of the valley's agricultural landscape persisted through
the suburbanization of the San Francisco Peninsula. The allure of the
valley's climate and natural surroundings became a major draw for
post-war suburbanites seeking jobs in the new high technology sector
burgeoning throughout the Peninsula. An expectation of living among the
orchards formed an important component of how residents thought about
nature in their communities.</p>

<p><strong>"Carved from a Forest of Fruit Trees": City Annexations and
Environmental Limits</strong> &middot; <em>coming soon</em></p>
<p>Many municipalities in the Bay Area underwent aggressive expansion in
the postwar years, but none more so than San Jose. Under the tenure of
City Manager Dutch Hamann, San Jose grew from seventeen square miles to 134
square miles in twenty years. But in the process, the annexations
and rapid urban growth introduced environmental problems the city failed
to anticipate.</p>

<p><strong>"The Stanford Land Machine has Gone Berserk!" Stanford
University and the Stanford Industrial Park</strong> &middot; <em>coming soon</em></p>
<p>Stanford University is the largest landholder on the San Francisco
Peninsula, controlling nearly 9,000 acres stretching from Palo Alto up until the Santa Cruz Mountains. In the 1950s, Stanford started
acting as a real estate developer, first with the establishment of the
Stanford Industrial Park in 1953 and later through several additional
land development programs. These programs, however, ran into conflict
with surrounding neighborhoods whose ideas for the land did not include
industrialization.</p>
