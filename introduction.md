This project explores the historical relationship between nature and Silicon Valley. *Machines in the Valley* seeks to investigate, represent, and analyze the social, political, and environmental changes to document Silicon Valley's consequence for California and American history. 

Silicon Valley represented a new vision for the American West's political economy, an economic and political project marrying pastoral idealism with high tech urbanism. The urban form of the valley sought to overcome the urban industrial model of the Northeast and Midwest that had dominated the industrial centers of the U.S. As the Rust Belt decayed, discourse about what to do with this flagging industrial economy emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. A moment of possibility emerged for Silicon Valley. But as developers, planners, and business leaders tried to implement their vision, it ran into conflict with the suruban vision of open spaces, access to leisure, and freedom from pollution that white collar workers had come to expect. An environmental politic formed concurrently with the growth regime in Santa Clara County, and these two visions for the landscape came into contact with one another.

Between 1945 and 1990, the Santa Clara Valley experienced profound 
environmental change during an unprecedented wave of urban and 
industrial growth. With those changes came conflict over landscape 
change. Answering that question means extending historian Kenneth 
Jackson's observation that "the space around us---the physical 
organization of neighborhoods, roads, yards, houses, and 
apartments---sets up living patterns that condition our behavior."[^3] In 
Silicon Valley, the attitudes, ideas, and values that people impart on 
to nature---biological and idealized---reveals how ideas about nature 
played out in postindustrial American society. By examining the ways 
that people created place, the politics they engaged in to protect that 
place, and examining the physical changes to the landscape that 
resulted, my research argues for the importance of understanding how 
space creates politics. The story revolves around whose space Silicon 
Valley would become: A postindustrial trend-setter? A fertile and 
beautiful agricultural producer? A countryside paradise? A metropolitan 
leader?

Space forms the central component of my work. Geographer John Wright has 
argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise 
of power and resistance to it vie for dominance."[^1] Physical and 
conceptual boundaries were drawn around competing landscapes in the Bay 
Area. These boundaries encapsulated three landscapes: agriculture, 
industry, and suburbs. By examining 
what Richard White called hybrid landscapes, I argue the 
interconnections between these competing idealized landscapes shaped 
environmental, cultural, and political identities in the Bay Area.[^2]

Much of the site is a "work in progress." As a whole, the project seeks to make available materials to exlore the history of Silicon Valley and its impact on American history by exploring the social and political underpinnings of environmentalism.

### Project Team

**Jason A. Heppler** is the Digital Engagement Librarian and an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and a researcher with Stanford University's Spatial History Project. He received his Ph.D. in history from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2016 and is working on his first book on environmental politics in Silicon Valley.

### Essays, Publications, and Whitepapers 

As essays, articles, reports, and white papers are produced with research data and visualizations from this project, they will appear below.

- "Green Dreams, Toxic Legacies: Toward a Digital Political Ecology of Silicon Valley," *International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing*, accepted for publication.

### News and Updates

Much of this project is still a work-in-progress. Features, analysis, 
and narrative will appear over time as ways for me to ask questions of 
my research, illustrate points I'm trying to make, and extend upon 
subjects and themes covered in my book. Various aspects 
of the project are bound to change over time and I will try and record them here.

- *2017-08-03* &middot; Updated San Jose narrative elements. 
- *2017-07-25* &middot; Added historic base maps to San Jose annexation.
- *2017-03-27* &middot; Added the Introduction.
- *2017-06-30* &middot; Added table of county population growth to annexation visualizations. Added Mountain View annexation visualization.
- *2017-07-05* &middot; Added traffic visualizations. Removed the About page and replaced with the Introduction.

This project is under version control. If you'd like to see all of the updates the project has gone through, you can follow the updates on [Github](https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley).
