abstract: "A key criticism of conservationists and environmentalists in the Bay Area focused on the massive uptick in traffic that resulted in smog obscuring the views that many residents enjoyed. Here is a snapshot of where people were commuting from in order to visually understand the traffic flow between suburban homes and suburban offices."

### About the Visualization

A persistent environmental critique of the Bay Area was the region's
growing traffic problems, which not only caused heavy congestion but
promoted smog that obscured the Valley's prized views. In 1958, the
Santa Clara County Planning Commission reported on journey-to-work
problems on the San Francisco Peninsula.

The visualization begins to confirm the argument&#8212;mine and
others&#8212;that there existed an imbalance between the places people lived
and the places people worked. These places were defined by city
policies. Specifically, the visualization reflects a heavy concentration
of commuters leaving San Jose for other parts of the Bay Area for their
jobs.
