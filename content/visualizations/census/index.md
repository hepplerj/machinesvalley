### About the Visualization
  
The rise of high-tech manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley provided new employment opportunities for African Americans locating to the postwar valley. However, their opportunity to participate in suburban living was isolated until the end of the 1970s. Restrictive covenants and redlining initially forced African Americans into Northside properties. By the 1950s, roughly forty percent of the South Bay's 1,718 black population lived in Northside. Similarly, the county's Mexican Americans occupied the enclave of East San Jose, known as Eastside, while Japanese Americans were restricted to downtown and Northside. Southern and western neighborhoods of San Jose were essentially off limits to nonwhites.
  
Black families were often steered towards declining areas. East Palo Alto represented the typical experience: the unincorporated city was socially, infrastructurally, and financially isolated from its neighboring cities. When Bayshore Freeway (Highway 101) was widened in the middle of the twentieth century the freeway became what the NAACP's *The Crisis* referred to as the "concrete curtain."[^1] When the California State Planning Commission went ahead with plans to widen the freeway in the late 1950s as a major corridor for trafﬁc between San Francisco and the growing tech industries of Santa Clara Valley, little effort was made to preserve East Palo Alto businesses which mostly lined the freeway. The freeway project appeared willing to curve around other commercial districts, but the ﬁfty-three East Palo Alto businesses lining the old four-lane freeway were displaced. The widening of the freeway also caused greater ﬂooding problems in the city and lowered land values, causing residential and business developers to look elsewhere.[^2]
