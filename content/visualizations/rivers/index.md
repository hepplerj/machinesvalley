<h3>About the Map</h3>

<p>
Throughout Silicon Valley, local and regional interests found expression
on the Bay Area landscape through activities deemed the proper use for the
land. Landscapes, as Richard White <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24453057">reminds us</a>, are a mix of dynamic
cultural and natural systems that create place. Landscapes are physical
and mental maps according to preferences and experiences, which affect
the environment through the <em>intent</em> and <em>actual</em> use of land. These
are what White calls a hybrid landscape.
</p>

<p>
I argue that these overlapping landscapes&#8212;open space, industrial
space, residential space, and the natural environment&#8212;shaped
environmental politics in Silicon Valley. How people thought about the
land and its proper use had a profound influence on environmental
debates. The map illustrates the physical manifestation of a particular
landscape's presence on the San Francisco Peninsula.
