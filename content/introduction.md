This project explores the post-World War II development of environmental politics in Silicon Valley. *Machines in the Valley* seeks to investigate, represent, and analyze the social, political, and environmental changes to document Silicon Valley's consequence for California and American history.

Silicon Valley represented a new vision for the American West's political economy, an economic and political project marrying pastoral idealism with high tech urbanism. The urban form of the valley sought to overcome the urban industrial model of the Northeast and Midwest that had dominated the industrial centers of the U.S. As the Rust Belt decayed, discourse about what to do with this flagging industrial economy emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. A moment of possibility emerged for Silicon Valley. But as developers, planners, and business leaders tried to implement their vision, it ran into conflict with the suburban vision of open spaces, access to leisure, and freedom from pollution that white collar workers had come to expect. An environmental politic formed concurrently with the growth regime in Santa Clara County, and these two visions for the landscape came into contact with one another.

Between 1945 and 1990, the Santa Clara Valley experienced profound 
environmental change during an unprecedented wave of urban and 
industrial growth. With those changes came conflict over landscape 
change. Answering that question means extending historian Kenneth 
Jackson's observation that "the space around us---the physical 
organization of neighborhoods, roads, yards, houses, and 
apartments---sets up living patterns that condition our behavior."[^3] In 
Silicon Valley, the attitudes, ideas, and values that people impart on 
to nature---biological and idealized---reveals how ideas about nature 
played out in postindustrial American society. By examining the ways 
that people created place, the politics they engaged in to protect that 
place, and examining the physical changes to the landscape that 
resulted, my research argues for the importance of understanding how 
space creates politics. The story revolves around whose space Silicon 
Valley would become: A postindustrial trend-setter? A fertile and 
beautiful agricultural producer? A countryside paradise? A metropolitan 
leader?

*Machines in the Valley* seeks to use maps and immersive storytelling to
demonstrate and narrate the process of landscape change in Silicon Valley
between 1940 and 2010. The project combines detailed historic maps and curated
visual stories to explore the racial, environmental, social, and political
geographies of Silicon Valley. Inspired by geographer John Wright who 
argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise 
of power and resistance to it vie for dominance,"[^1] *Machines in the Valley*
explores these shifting physical and conceptual boundaries. By examining 
what Richard White called hybrid landscapes, I argue the 
interconnections between these competing idealized landscapes shaped 
environmental, cultural, and political identities in the Bay Area.[^2]

As a whole, the project seeks to make available materials to explore the history of Silicon Valley and its impact on American history by exploring the social and political underpinnings of environmentalism.
