## Description

-   The `data` directory contains several sources of data. For example, 
    the `data/sv-companies` directory contains a `csv` of technology 
    companies in the Bay Area between 1945 and 2000. Each directory 
    contains the data plus a `txt` or `md` file explaining the contents, 
    provenance, and any data transformations I might have made on 
    pre-compiled data. In some cases, these directories may also 
    include an original data source (e.g., GIS shapefiles).
-   Most of the other directories are standard [Jekyll][] files and 
    hierarchy.
