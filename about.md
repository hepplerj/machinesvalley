*Machines in the Valley* is a digital history project that serves as a 
companion to my dissertation. My research is on the environmental 
history of Silicon Valley and the emergence of environmental politics in 
the face of metropolitan growth.

Between 1945 and 1990, the Santa Clara Valley experienced profound 
environmental change during an unprecedented wave of urban and 
industrial growth.

These competing visions of the Santa Clara landscape reflected 
widely-held and conflicting ideas about the future of the Valley. In the 
face of residential growth and industrial development, the Santa Clara 
Valley’s landscape changed remarkably. The arrival of machines in the 
Valley — bulldozers and computers — transformed the landscape, and in 
the process sparked local environmental activism. Valley residents, 
business leaders, city officials, and university administrators vied 
over the definition of Santa Clara Valley’s future, and in the process 
shaped debates about environmental change. Unrestricted urban growth and 
economic development characterized much of Santa Clara Valley in the 
latter half of the twentieth century, but little told is the story of 
the environmental consequences of Silicon Valley and those who attempted 
to shape the region’s environmental future. California voters became 
increasingly aware of the environmental impact urban and industrial 
development was having, leading by the 1970s to residents attempting to 
curtail industrialization, limit urban growth, and reject large-scale 
water projects. Environmental organizations, formal and ad hoc, such as 
the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, 
and California Tomorrow, began criticizing high technology firms and 
city leaders for their ignorance of ecological negligence. These 
organizations formed the evolving Bay Area environmental movement.

What gives rise to the environmental movement in the Santa Clara Valley 
are the spatial and cultural politics stemming from high-tech 
industrialization.

By exploring the ways people created space, the politics they engaged in 
to protect that space, and examining the physical changes to the 
landscape this dissertation argues for the importance of understanding 
how space creates politics. The story of Silicon Valley told here is 
over who’s place the Valley would become: Industrial powerhouse? Fertile 
and beautiful? Residential paradise? Metropolitan leader?

The metropolitan region of the Santa Clara Valley allows for an 
important inquiry into postwar environmentalism. The Bay Area in many 
respects anticipated the environmental politics that played out on the 
national stage. Ten years before federal laws regulated clean air, water 
contamination, and the preservation of open space, environmental 
political actors in the Bay Area organized to preserve their quality of 
life, the preservation of landscapes, and formed critiques of 
environmental degradation.
