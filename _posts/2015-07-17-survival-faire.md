Before Earth Day 1970, students at San Jose State University hosted Survival Faire that same year. The event emerged from Professor John Sperling's Humanities 160 course with the purpose of raising awareness about ecological matters, particularly galvanized around anti-smog measures and support for public transportation. As part of their publicity plan, the students pushed a brand-new, never-started Ford Maverick from the dealer's lot to the center of campus, where it was ceremoniously buried in a 12 foot deep pit.
