Report: air pollution in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Bay Area Council (Calif.) 

San Francisco [1949] 

REPORT ON AIR POLLUTION 
IN THE San Francisco Bay Area 

Prepared by the Bay Area Council on the 
problem of air pollution in the San Francisco 
Bay Area, and subrnitted for consideration 
by the Baywide conference of supervisors, 
and other organisations interested in taking 
any action required on this situation. 

I. THE PROBLEM 

Air pollution has gained nationwide attention, 
particularly in Pittsburgh, Pa.. Los 
Angeles, and other US. cities and metropolitan 
areas. The possibility of this problem 
in the San Francisco Bay Area has been given 
consideration by civic and industrial organisations 
and local govermnent. 

The Executive Committee of the Bay Area 
Council approved action by this areawide development 
organisation in making an informal 
study of the air pollution situation, as 
requested bya Baywide conference of supervisors 
of the nine Bay counties, through the 
office of Supervisor Edward Mancuso of San 
Francisco, acting Chairman. 

Mr. Mancuso's request to the Council 
stated: 

"As the result of the meeting held in the 
Chaxnbers of the Board of Supervisors in 
the Alarneda County Courthouse on February 
16, 1949, concerning air pollution 
in the Bay Area, it was the consensus of 
opinion of the people attending said meeting 
that the matter be referred to the 
San Francisco Bay Area Council, Inc. 
They expressed the opinion that you might 
give this matter further study and make 
recommendations as to whether or not 
immediate steps should be taken by the 
Bay Area Counties for the purpose of 
forming a Bay Area Pollution District."

INFORMATION CONCERNING AIR POLLUTION 

I 

1) Definition: Air pollution includes: 
soil dust, gaseous by products of manufacturing, 
gas exhaust from motor vehicles, and 
fuel combustion of coal, oil and other products, 
which, under certain conditions, may create 
anuisance in the Area. Inextreme conditions, 
air pollution may prove toxic tovegetation, 
animals and humans. 

The scientific ultimate of all waste material, 
whether in the form of sewage, liquids 
or gases, from all human habitation calls for 
its disposal by dilution, either into rivers, 
bays or oceans, or into the air. There is no 
such thing as elirninating pollution. There is 
only a problem of controlling the degree of 
pollution, so that it does not create a nuisance, 
nor become harmful to vegetation, animals 
or hurnan beings. 

2) Local Aspects: The San Francisco 
Bay Area is one of the world's mostfortun 
ately situated metropolitan regions in terms 
of air pollution, as well as water pollution. 
The volume of Bay waters moving in and out 
on each tide, according to authoritative engineering 
sources, are ample for disposal by 
dilution, after minimurn treatment, of the 
sewage of more than 25 million people, or 
ten times the present population. 

The atrnospheric situation in the bayarea, 
with the 450 square miles of Bay waters, and 
the Golden Gate serving as a wind funnel, 
provides a dilution zone for air pollution of 
similar magnitude. Prevailing winds in the 
Area provide a volurne of air adequate for 
the dilution of dust and furnes from an immeasurable 
total of industrial production provided 
that abuses are controlled. 

3) Examples - Air Pollution Areas: It 
is generally conceded by responsible authorities 
that in California localities where there 
is any evidence of air pollution. the problems 
are concerned with dust and fumes, rather 
than smoke. Practically all sources of smoke 

5 

Co 816 

are already regulated, or can be regulated, 
quite easily under proper control measures. 

A) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania notoriously 
known as "The Smoky City" for many 
years, has tackled this problem through the 
Allegheny Conference for Civic and Economic 
Development. This group has expedited the 
initial steps taken to abate the smoke situation 
in the industrial and residential area. It 
should be pointed out that the Pittsburgh situation 
does not especially relate to the Bay / 
Area since their major problem was control 
of smoke caused by coal burning industries 
and home furnaces. 

B) The los_angeles County area has 
received nationwide unfavourable - publicity 
from its unfortunate experience with air pollution, 
or "smog", largely developed as an 
atmospheric nuisance during the war and 
postwar years, concurrently with Southern 
California's population and economic growth. 
Such cases involve a number of gaseous byproducts 
emanating from various production 
sources, which may combine under certain ' 
atomspheric conditions to create new types 
of pollutants in the area. 

There has been tight and rigid regulation 
established in both the Pittsburgh and Los 
Angeles areas, but wherever possible, as in 

the Bay Area, voluntary ontrol is u h to 3 
be desired. 0386: do Ar W 

The Stanford Research Institute has been 
conducting exhaustive surveys of the air 
contaminants in the los_angeles County area 
under the sponsorship of the Western Oil and 
Gas Association, starting June 2, 1947, and 
still underway. 

Quoting from that report - "Smog is a 
term made by combining parts of the two 
words ‘smoke’ and ‘fog’. Properly applied 
in the los_angeles County region, 
it denotes an abnormal weather condition 
in which man made contarninants in the 
air mingle with haze or fog to produce a 

6 

c0 816 

dense, smoky atmosphere. It results in 
a sharp reduction invisibility, and causes 
irritation of the eyes, and sometimes of 
the nose and throat. 

"Unpleasant odours are also sometimes 

associated in public complaints with 

smoggy weather conditions, but they almost 
invariably arise from local, easily 
identifiable sources, and are not genuinely 
connected with the more general and 
characteristic aspects of smog. 

"Smog of the type which irritates the eyes / 
is severe in the los_angeles basin ten 
or twenty times a year, in attacks lasting 
four hours or less, and occurring most 
frequently in the late morning hours of 
the summer and autumn months. It seldom 
occurs during stormy or cloudy 
weather. 

"Although severe smog is not cornrnon, 
threshold smog conditions (or conditions 
approaching smog) occur with much greater 
frequency. During threshold days a 
certain percentage of people find that 
their eyes are irritated, and measure / 
show the number of times they 
must blink is greater than normal..." 

"As to the mechanism of smog... the air 
arriving over los_angeles County at 
levels higher than the surface layer has 
been subjected toconsiderable downward 
motion which has compressed and heated \ 
it. The temperature contrast is further 
exaggerated when the bottom layer or 
seepage air is cooled from below, in 
passing over the relatively cold band of 
water up welling just off the California 
coast to replace surface shore waters 
swept out into the Pacific by the high 
pressure area winds. The temperature 
inversion layer is a result of these 
phenomena... The inversion layer acts as 
a canopy over the entire los_angeles 
basin, preventing contarninated air from 
escaping vertically, and, by resting against 

7 

c0 816 

the mountains, preventing it also from 
escaping toward the east..." 

"Those days on which severe smog occurs 
are strikingly sixnilar with respect 
to certain meteorological conditions: a 
strong, low inversion must be present; 
the low inversion must be accompanied 
by several days of stagnant air; and the 
temperature must be above normal for 
the time at which the smog occurs... 

"Other industrialised cities also have 
their air pollution problems; those of 
Pittsburgh and St. Louis are notorious. 
And there have been isolated instances of 
air contamination sufficient to cause eye 
irriation in New York, Chicago. Paris, 
and Rome. But in these cities it is a 
rare occurrence. Frequent and powerfully 
eye irritating smog appear to be 
peculiar to the los_angeles area." 

The los_angeles County prograrn to control 
air pollution has involved heavy expenditures 
in engineering surveys required and 
in adxninistrative agencies established. 

III THE CURRENT "SMOG" SITUATION IN 
THE San Francisco Bay Area 

A brief study of the air pollution problem 
in the San Francisco Bay Area leads to the 
following preliminary conclusions as to the 
scope and intensity of the present problem: 

(1) There does not appear to be any 
sound basis for consideration of air pollution 
or "smog", as a serious problem in the San 
Francisco Bay Area at this time. This does 
not mean that consideration should not be 
given to proper measures of regulation and 
control of any existing airpollution situation 
and the Council's recommendations will e -

V’ 

Sap N “- 

In the few cases where some concern has 
been expressed by various public and private 
agencies. including the press, as to air pol 

3 

c0 316 

lution in the Bay Area, these cases have been 
traced to unusual atrnospheric conditions 
bringing malodors from the sewage sludge 
areas at the eastern end of the Bay Bridge 
and in San Leandro Bay, or from industries 
whose gaseous by products are usuallydi 
luted eastward by offshore winds. 

(2) The phenomenal growth of the San 
Francisco Bay Area in the past ten years, 
bringing nearly one million new residents, 
tens of thousands of new homes and more 
than one half billion dollars in new and expanded 
industries into the nine Bay counties 
since 1940 may lead to the assuxnption that 
a larger voluxne of air pollutants are released 
into the atmosphere of the Area than 
existed prior to that time. It should be pointed 
out, however, that the majority of these 
new industries and new dwellings are not 
necessarily of the type that produce air pollution. 
and those that do, have taken more 
than adequate steps to recover such wastes 
as useful products, or to avoid creating a 
nuisance under normal conditions. 

(3) In the Bay Area. there have been only 
two incidents in the past two years that resemble 
nuisance "smog" as it has been reported 
in other areas. There is no evidence 
as to where these originated beyond the fact 
that climatical conditions at that time were 
most unusual, and wind drifts which normally 
move air pollutants upward and away from 
inhabited areas reversed their course to 
bring the malodors to the attention of San 
Francisco and other Bay Area communities. 

(4) Industry problem: The majority of 
Bay Area industries have consistently practised 
technical and engineering controls of 
gaseous and other waste by products over a 
long period of years. The petroleurn refineries 
of Richmond and the North Bay Area have 
pioneered many of the nation's outstanding 
installations of equipment for recovery of 
gaseous by products, in many cases to the 
economic advantage of the firms and the communities. 
Many important products, such as 

9 

Co 816 

sulphur. hydrogen sulphide, sulphuric acid 
and other acids. organic and non organic 
chemicals are extractedfrom by products of 
petroleum plants, and fromother industries 
of the Area. / 

A typical example of pollutant control is 
the installation of the bag house and towering 
landmark of the giant smokestack of the 
American Smelting and Refining Company, 
near Selby, on the north Bayshore. One of 
the world's tallest smokestacks.rising 605 
feet in height, these units were builtby the 
company to eliminate possibility of nuisance 
from sulphur dioxide gases or damageto vegetation 
in that area. 

In years past. the by products of abat / 
meat packing plants and fish canneries 
were burned with malodorous effect, but 
this has been controlled by ordinance in which 
by products are refined to dry meal under 
special controls. The odorous elements are 
now even scrubbed from the smokestacks so 
that even the traces of malodors from controlled 
drying will not be carried out of the 
plant. 

Burning sawdust pits and stacks in Bay 
Area lumber mills and yards are also apos 
sible factor in air pollution to some. degree, 
although inmost cases such plants are located 
where dilution by prevailing winds creates 

little nuisance. 13.!» C 2-4- 

Industrial viewpoints on air pollution have 
normally been to maintain a constant engineering 
check of solid, liquid and gaseous 
by products to reduce the element of economic 
loss to the minimum by conversion 
of such materials to profitable uses. Most 
industries have also shownanincreasing regard 
for freindly relations with employees, 4 
the community and the general public by the 
reduction of various nuisance factors possibly 
caused by industry in the Area. It is 
only where the cost of such controlfactors 
reach a point where it is impossible to operate 
economically, that such situations call for 

-10- 

Co 816 

industry community cooperation and agreement. 
These factors of waste disposal, involving 
air or water pollution, have been taken 

into consideration for a number of years in 
the location of new plants or expanded industrial 
facilities in the Bay Area, with the cooperation 
of chambers of commerce and 
other civic and industrial organisations. 

In fact, two major Bay Area industries 
have odours of normallypleasant impact on the 
residents and visitors to the Area. Coffee 
and chocolate processing create definite 
aromas which are farniliar to many generations 
of San Franciscans, and these industries 
have been major sources of employinent and 
revenue to Bay Area comm rce for nearly a 

century. M ‘at’ ‘ 

(5) Community Problem: Inmany Bay 
Area communities, however, open raw sewage 
outfalls continue to exist as an air pollution 
factor, especially in the East Bay areas, and 
in such cases as the outlets adjoining the 
Candle Stick Cove housing area. In all such 
cases where raw, untreated human sewage is 
being discharged on shores and in sloughs of 
the Bay there is bound to be acontinuing 
malodorous air pollution, especially when 
prevailing winds carry the stenchinland to 

V residential reas. O “'5 F “O‘("' 

Action: The installation of huge sewage 
disposal. treatznent plants in sanfrancisco. 
Oakland and other Bay Area communities is 
beginning to reduce this malodorous air and 
water pollution so that, within the next two 
years, it is expected much of this type of 
contamination will be materially eliminated. 

Preliminary conclusion: While the majority 
of industries and communities in the 
Bay Area are taking steps to control air pollution 
it may be necessary to consider the 
initiation of voluntary community control 
measures that will insure aminimum irnpact 
of smoke and gaseous by products from some 
manufacturing facilities. The over all situation 
here is not comparable to the air pol 

-11- 

c0 816 

lution created by plants in the los_angeles 
harbour area as they currently affect the 
Pasadena altadena residential area, with the 
possible exception of the East Bay. Normally 
much more favourable air dilution conditions 
exist in the East Bay, which will disperse, 
in proportionately larger volurnes, industrial 
by products without malodorous or other 
nuisance effects. 

IV POSSIBLE EXISTING NUISANCES 
IN THE BAY AREA 

/1" (1) Burning garbage dum are..one of 

. the localised sources of air pollution in many 
[ communities of the Bay Area. San Francisco 
1 and Oakland garbage is never burned, as 
‘l garbage disposal authorities in these cities 
\ believe that the value of burning for space 
‘ saving or other purposes, does not outweigh 
N the nuisance created by garbage smoke and 
fumes. Any fires seen on garbage duxnps of 
these two major cities are from spontaneous 
combustion, and are quickly extinguished. 

Numerous other Bay Communities, how 

A ever, continue to burn rubbish at their gar' 

'dumps. In many cases, these cities are 

‘\ among those most interested in attracting 
\ residential development to their area. 

From unpublished work by others (SRI 
Report) it has been shown that burning rubbish 
and especially green wood cuttings may produce 
as high as 60o parts per million by 
volume of formaldehyde in the vapours, which 
are definite factors in the eye irritant quali 
ity of contaminating air pollution in the Los 
Angeles area. 

(2) Automobile exhaust gases have been 
shown, by scientific test under some conditions, 

to carry some concentration of higher 
hydrocarbons, in addition to carbon monoxide. 


The increase in the number of gas com 
bustion motor buses used in the Bay Area 
during recent years, together with the tremendous expansion of the trucking industry, and 
other passenger and express automotive 
equipment. has undoubtedly increased the 
volume of air pollutionfrom these sources. 
This is especially true when gas driven 
motor vehicles are of the older type, with 
poor combustion and leaky manifolds. 

_ In cases of certain types of gas combus 
tion engine buses, where the exhaust manifold 
is located at the lower rear of the vehicle, the 
exhaust gas discharge may be drawn into the 
ventilating front of the following vehicle, especially 
when they are parked in close proximity 
at stop signals. 

California, because of its lfi ghstandaid of 
living, now has the largest nurnber of automobiles 
of any state in the nation and the Bay 
Area had atotal registration of 886, 093 passenger 
and truck vehicles registered by latest 
record (1948). This is an increase of 15.9% 
over the registration for 1946 - 764, 400. 

(3) Engineering experts have pointed out 
that some "smog" factors, where black or 
dark grey smoke is seen coming from certain 
plants, hotels, commercial buildings, and 
apartrnent houses, can be minimised by attention 
to highest efficiency in insurance operations, 
which also conserves fuel costs for 

the industry. 

In many instances, faulty combustion of 
carbonous fuels is due to need for haste in 
firing furnaces during early morning hours, 
or to adjustments of fuel feeding service which 
yield heavy smoke and pollutants. The increased 
installation of natural gas heating 
equipment, and the decreasing usage of coal, 
low grade fuel oils and other highcarbon 
producing fuels in Bay Area plants, commercial 
buildings and dwellings has substantially 
reduced this factor in present and future air 
pollution volurne.

V RESEARCH APPROACH TO 
AIR POLLUTION 

The Council has reviewed the possibilities 
of a technical and detailed research study of 
air pollution in the Bay Area with several important 
agencies which are equipped and prepared 
to conduct such surveys. 

On the premise that the facts about air 
pgllution in the Bay Area would be a guiding 
point for planning and action to control such 
a nuisance if it exists, the Council has conferred 
with Stanford Research Institute (Air 
Pollution Laboratory) and with Air Research 
Associates, of Pasadena, California, and has 
reviewed similar steps toward air pollution 
research recommended in other areas. 

These projects generally recommend extensive 
and expensive research into the atmospheric 
and meteorological factors. of the 
Bay Area, into public opinion in the communities, 
and into chemical and physical studies 
showing the amount of dust and soot, sulphur 
dioxide and other gases, and the visibility 
expressed in the air. 

Other aspects of air pollution research 
may cover the trajectories, or pathways, of 
air pollutants; the possible maximum concentration 
of air pollution and where it might 
occur; the effect of air pollution onhomes, 
business, land values and industrial growth of 
the area. ’ 

All such studies would ordinarily lead to 
a series of recommendations to correct and 
control any existing air pollution beyond the 
normal, non nuis ance situation to be expected 
in a large metropolitan centre of population 
and industry. 

However, from the facts available, it is 
not believed any extensive researchaproject 
is Justified at this time. 

This report is another contribution to 
the development of the San Francisco Bay 
Area. It is one of a series of studies and 
reports issued by the Bay Area Council to 
stimulate action by communities and organisations 
interested in the future growth of the 
Area. 

The Bay Area Council can and does assist 
other organisations in the nine counties bordering 
the Bay to unite their forces in planning 
for the general development of the Area, ‘ 
in solving area wide economic problems and 
in advancing the interest of the people of the 
Bay Area as a whole. 

The effectiveness of the Council's programme 
of research, panning, and promotional 

development is increased by studies of this 
kind.

TO THE CONFERENCE OF SUPERVISORS AND ldfl “Mc: Hfi7 
OTHER BAY AREA ORGANISATIONS 1. 

In accordance with your request, herewith 
is a preliminary analysis of the air 
pollution problem in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. It is presented to the Baywide conference 
of supervisors and civic and industrial 
organisations interested in this problem 
as it affects the present and future 
welfare of the nine Bay counties. 

This report does not represent a complete 
appraisal of the existing situation, 
and is subject to revision as new information 
is developed by various agencies of 
government and other sources. 

one of the Bay Area's greatest natural 
assests is its climatical advantages, which 
are reflected in the healthful living and 
working conditions in Baywide comunities, 
factories and homes. 

The Council urges that planning and 
action on all forms of possible pollution 
control be adopted only after careful technical 
consideration has proved that such 
steps will provide facilities demonstrated 
to be needed for the protection of the public 
against the hazards of the spread of disease, 
or to preserve the air, water and land in 
such quality as to be to the public benefit 
and of most importance to the over all economy 
of the Bay Area. 

This end can bezeached by Bay Area communities 
and industries being consistently 
vigilant and cooperative in taking whatever 
voluntary measures are deemed necessary to 
balance the scales of civic and economic 
growth in the Area.

Original from 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 

REPORT ON AIR POLLUTION 
IN THE San Francisco Bay Area 

S U M M A R Y 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

It is an accepted and generally recognised 
fact that the Bay Area is not now concerned 
with any continuing degree of nuisance in the 
form of air pollution, excepting the malodors 
created by certain sewage sludge areas, and 
by burning garbage and other localised situations 
which can be controlled. 

The Bay Area is fortunate in having one 
of the nation's best locations for maximum 
.control and dispersion of any existing air 
pollution by prevailing winds and other atmospheric 
conditions. 

The Area is also fortunate in that it can 
approach this problem from a voluntary and 
cooperative point of View because no critical 
condition. appears at this time, nor is expected 
to appear for a number of years. In 
some other industrialised areas possibilities 
of the situation were not recognised and there 
was little effort directed toward air pollution 
control until the situation became adefinite 
nuisance. Thereupon, hastily prepared legislation 
was enacted at a cost of time, manpower, 
equipment and public funds which 
created an economic loss to the community 
and the region. This can and should be avoided 
in the Bay Area. 

POL IC Y 

The basic policy to be applied is that 
those sources of smoke and other pollution 
which can be eliminated without economic 
loss, and with due regard for the nuisance 
factor in environmental living, should be 
controlled by voluntary action of civic, industrial 
and other responsible community 
organisations. 

c0 816 

This will aid in maintaining amaximuxn 
volurne of fresh, unpolluted air. Selective 
industries and other community activities 
can use this air for dilution of any gaseous 
by products. If this fresh air were not available, 
the cost of controlling the gaseous byproducts 
could put the local industries in an 
unfavourable competitive position with other 
US. industries, and thereby reduce the volume 
of employrnent and economic well-being 
in the Area. 

FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS 

The recommendations for Bay Area planning 
and action on control of present or anticipated 
air pollution which, according to 
responsible authorities is not generally acknowledged 
to exist in the Bay Area at this 
tirne, may follow this pattern: 

1. Establishrnent of a Bay Area Air Pollution 
Group - or of a Bay Area Waste Disposal 
Group - which shall be comprised of 
authorities in the field of sanitary and industrial 
engineering, in industry, governrnent and 
private or public technical agencies. The 
€ounci1 would be willing to undertake the formation 
of such a group as acommittee of the 
Council if desired. This group would serve 
as a clearing house of technical information, 
and provide other assistance and counsel in 
analysing and recommending planning and 
action prograxns for the control of air pollution 
or, on the broader basis, on water 
pollution and other sewage and waste disposal 
problems affecting the present and 
future economic welfare of the communities 
and people of the San Francisco Bay Area. 

2. The establishment of voluntary community 
programmes in which operators of industry, 
commercial buildings and multiple 
dwellings, as well as the general public, cooperate 
with local government to reduce any 
existing or potential "smog" nuisance or air 
pollution which is controllable. 

It does not seem essential to conduct an 
extensive research survey on air pollution at 
this time, as the costs and efforts involved
