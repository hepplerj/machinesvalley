<p>The map displays the general agencies that administer the open spaces of Santa Clara County. <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Country_in_the_City/DsKVrqGFUJMC">According to the geographer</a> Richard Walker, collectively there are more acres of open space in the nine-county Bay Area than in the entirety of Yosemite National Park. The efforts of conservationists over the course of the twentieth century resulted in several thousands of acres being placed under various agencies for their management.</p>
<p>Among the more prominent conservation activists in Santa Clara County were People for Open Space and California Tomorrow. People for Open Space had its origins in a June 1958 conference where the issues of California&rsquo;s metropolitan areas rapidly overrunning recreational space were a core concern. The organization&rsquo;s founders were natural activists. Led by Dorothy Erskine and Jack Kent, they got their start in various political efforts in the Bay Area including housing and labor activism, urban planning, and agricultural land preservation. People for Open Space developed many studies and white papers on conservation, with their most important piece published in 1969. Supported by a Ford Foundation grant, the organization laid out a vision for Peninsula open space to guide places against urban expansion. &ldquo;A major open space system can be created only on a regional basis,&rdquo; argued the study, &ldquo;because open space exists without regard to city or county boundaries. . . . To establish permanent open space, all parts of the region must act together, probably using types of legislation not currently available to counties or even special districts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alongside the efforts of People for Open Space was the nonprofit educational organization California Tomorrow. In 1962, it published <em>California Going, Going. . .</em>, whose opening sentences reiterated the &ldquo;serious, progressively disastrous lack of coordinated land planning and development&rdquo; in California. Founded by the former newspaper editor Alfred Heller and former state government employee Samuel Wood, the organization produced the journal <em>Cry California</em> in 1966 to cover issues on environmental decline, race and class discrimination, housing shortages, and job inequalities. The journal became a major outlet for conservationists sketching out a new vision for the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Their efforts continued into the 1970s with the publication of <em>The California Tomorrow Plan</em> in 1971. The <em>California Tomorrow Plan</em> proposed a comprehensive initiative to address state infrastructure and environment, arguing that there existed two Californias. &ldquo;California One&rdquo; imagined a California without any change to these policies, which would be unable to meet the state&rsquo;s energy needs, deteriorate water quality and accessibility, continue the urbanization of farmland, lose wilderness areas and open spaces, worsen air quality, increase noise pollution, clog roadways, cause greater housing shortages, result in underfunded and understaffed schools, widespread unemployment especially among minorities, fall short in recreational areas, and emphasize punitive rather than rehabilitative treatment of criminals. To overcome these challenges, California Tomorrow envisioned a different California&ndash;&ldquo;California Two&rdquo;&ndash;comprised of a State Planning Council to develop comprehensive policies addressing a wide range of environmental, social, and economic issues in the state.</p>
