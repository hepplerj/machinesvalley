&lt;p>The Mayfair neighborhood was a key site of Latinx activism focused on halting racial discrimination, calling for greater participation in electoral politics, labor rights, and a critique of San Jose&amp;rsquo;s growth policies. Latinx activism and environmental regulations became entwined with debates over citizenship and discrimination, prompting activists to call for environmental equality alongside their challenges to racial inequality, citizenship, and segregation. Even economic issues that appeared neutral, such as zoning, sewer hookups, and street paving, became a core tenant of political organizing. After a months-long voter registration drive registered thousands of new Latinx voters, the San Jose city council reacted by approving new street and sewer projects for the eastern edges of the city.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>African American Population Change, 1960—1970</title><link>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/census/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/census/</guid><description>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

&lt;p>The rise of high-tech manufacturing jobs in Silicon Valley provided new employment opportunities for African Americans locating to the postwar valley. However, their opportunity to participate in suburban living was isolated until the end of the 1970s. Restrictive covenants and redlining initially forced African Americans into Northside properties. By the 1950s, roughly forty percent of the South Bay&amp;rsquo;s 1,718 black population lived in Northside. Similarly, the county&amp;rsquo;s Mexican Americans occupied the enclave of East San Jose, known as Eastside, while Japanese Americans were restricted to downtown and Northside. Southern and western neighborhoods of San Jose were essentially off limits to nonwhites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conservation Lands in Santa Clara County</title><link>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/openspace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/openspace/</guid><description>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

&lt;p>The map displays the general agencies that administer the open spaces of Santa Clara County. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Country_in_the_City/DsKVrqGFUJMC">According to the geographer&lt;/a> Richard Walker, collectively there are more acres of open space in the nine-county Bay Area than in the entirety of Yosemite National Park. The efforts of conservationists over the course of the twentieth century resulted in several thousands of acres being placed under various agencies for their management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Among the more prominent conservation activists in Santa Clara County were People for Open Space and California Tomorrow. People for Open Space had its origins in a June 1958 conference where the issues of California&amp;rsquo;s metropolitan areas rapidly overrunning recreational space were a core concern. The organization&amp;rsquo;s founders were natural activists. Led by Dorothy Erskine and Jack Kent, they got their start in various political efforts in the Bay Area including housing and labor activism, urban planning, and agricultural land preservation. People for Open Space developed many studies and white papers on conservation, with their most important piece published in 1969. Supported by a Ford Foundation grant, the organization laid out a vision for Peninsula open space to guide places against urban expansion. &amp;ldquo;A major open space system can be created only on a regional basis,&amp;rdquo; argued the study, &amp;ldquo;because open space exists without regard to city or county boundaries. . . . To establish permanent open space, all parts of the region must act together, probably using types of legislation not currently available to counties or even special districts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Journey-to-Work in the Bay Area, 1958</title><link>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/traffic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/traffic/</guid><description>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

&lt;p>A persistent environmental critique of the Bay Area was the region&amp;rsquo;s
growing traffic problems, which not only caused heavy congestion but
promoted smog that obscured the Valley&amp;rsquo;s prized views. In 1958, the
Santa Clara County Planning Commission reported on journey-to-work
problems on the San Francisco Peninsula.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The visualization begins to confirm the argument—mine and
others—that there existed an imbalance between the places people lived
and the places people worked. These places were defined by city
policies. Specifically, the visualization reflects a heavy concentration
of commuters leaving San Jose for other parts of the Bay Area for their
jobs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mountain View Annexations, 1950—1990</title><link>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/mountainview-annexations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/mountainview-annexations/</guid><description>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

Throughout Silicon Valley, local and regional interests found expression
on the Bay Area landscape through activities deemed the proper use for the
land. Landscapes, as Richard White &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24453057">reminds us&lt;/a>, are a mix of dynamic
cultural and natural systems that create place. Landscapes are physical
and mental maps according to preferences and experiences, which affect
the environment through the &lt;em>intent&lt;/em> and &lt;em>actual&lt;/em> use of land. These
are what White calls a hybrid landscape.

&lt;p>
The nine-county Bay Area underwent rapid population growth after World War II. Santa Clara County led the region in growth, in part because of efforts among municipalities to expand their size. The growth-as-progress contingent in city government led municipal political efforts at expansion, believing that the growth of their cities not only served the region better&amp;#8212;avoiding what the saw as petty bickering among many small communities&amp;#8212;but also served their interests by capturing a larger tax base and, in turn, fueling more efforts towards residential and industrial growth. The traditional urban centers of the Bay Area&amp;#8212;San Francisco, Oakland, and Richmond&amp;#8212;had seen their populations rise during the war years, but in the postwar era populations moved into the suburbs. Throughout the 1940s the population of Santa Clara County nearly doubled, and by the mid-1950s, nearly 4,000 new people were moving to the county every month. The county’s 1950 population of 290,547 people exploded to 642,365 by 1960, surpassing San Francisco as the region’s urban center.

&lt;p>Until the 1950s, San Jose remained a small town mostly tied to the agricultural industry. As a major fruit producer, market, and distribution center, the town catered to its hinterlands. But industrialists, merchants, and business owners felt that San Jose's reliance on the cyclical and sometimes unsteady agricultural industry undermined the city's attempts to grow. The growth coalition captured a majority on the city council in 1944, and quickly established a new regime dedicated to diversifying the city's industries by courting new high tech and manufacturing businesses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pollution Landscape, 1970—2000</title><link>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/superfund/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://machinesinthevalley.org/visualizations/superfund/</guid><description>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

In December 1981, Fairchild Semiconductor identified a chemical leak in one of its solvents storage tanks in South San Jose. A nearby well operated by the Great Oakes Water Company was discovered contaminated and promptly shut down, but neighbors in the area had for years wondered about the miscarriages, birth defects, stillbirths, and other health issues affecting their families. When news of the chemical leak broke in January 1982, neighborhoods began to question just how clean the "clean" industries of high tech really were. Subsequent investigations by state, county, and city government and the Environmental Protection Agency discovered widespread chemical leaks throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, many of which became eligible for Superfund funding. Out of twenty-nine sites investigated by the EPA, twenty-four were placed on the National Priorities List and designated Superfund sites. Santa Clara County has more Superfund sites than any other county in the United States.
