The urban form of the valley sought to overcome the urban industrial model of the Northeast and Midwest that had dominated the industrial centers of the U.S. As the Rust Belt decayed, discourse about what to do with this flagging industrial economy emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. A moment of possibility emerged for Silicon Valley. But as developers, planners, and business leaders tried to implement their vision, it ran into conflict with the suburban vision of open spaces, access to leisure, and freedom from pollution that white collar workers had come to expect. An environmental politic formed concurrently with the growth regime in Santa Clara County, and these two visions for the landscape came into contact with one another.</p><p>Between 1945 and 1990, the Santa Clara Valley experienced profound
environmental change during an unprecedented wave of urban and
industrial growth. With those changes came conflict over landscape
change. Answering that question means extending historian Kenneth
Jackson&rsquo;s observation that &ldquo;the space around us&mdash;the physical
organization of neighborhoods, roads, yards, houses, and
apartments&mdash;sets up living patterns that condition our behavior.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> In
Silicon Valley, the attitudes, ideas, and values that people impart on
to nature&mdash;biological and idealized&mdash;reveals how ideas about nature
played out in postindustrial American society. By examining the ways
that people created place, the politics they engaged in to protect that
place, and examining the physical changes to the landscape that
resulted, my research argues for the importance of understanding how
space creates politics. The story revolves around whose space Silicon
Valley would become: A postindustrial trend-setter? A fertile and
beautiful agricultural producer? A countryside paradise? A metropolitan
leader?</p><p><em>Machines in the Valley</em> seeks to use maps and immersive storytelling to
demonstrate and narrate the process of landscape change in Silicon Valley
between 1940 and 2010. The project combines detailed historic maps and curated
visual stories to explore the racial, environmental, social, and political
geographies of Silicon Valley. Inspired by geographer John Wright who
argued that &ldquo;places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise
of power and resistance to it vie for dominance,&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> <em>Machines in the Valley</em>
explores these shifting physical and conceptual boundaries. By examining
what Richard White called hybrid landscapes, I argue the
interconnections between these competing idealized landscapes shaped
environmental, cultural, and political identities in the Bay Area.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><p>As a whole, the project seeks to make available materials to explore the history of Silicon Valley and its impact on American history by exploring the social and political underpinnings of environmentalism.</p><h1 id=suggested-citation>Suggested citation</h1><p>If you use this project for academic work, here is a suggested citation.</p><blockquote><p>Jason Heppler, <em>Machines in the Valley: Growth, Conflict, and Environmental Politics in Silicon Valley</em>, website, code, and datasets (2024): <a href=https://machinesinthevalley.org/>https://machinesinthevalley.org/</a>.</p></blockquote><h1 id=essays-publications-and-whitepapers>Essays, Publications, and Whitepapers</h1><p>As essays, articles, reports, and white papers are produced with research data and visualizations from this project, they will appear below.</p><ul><li>My book, <em><a href=https://www.oupress.com/9780806193748/silicon-valley-and-the-environmental-inequalities-of-high-tech-urbanism/>Silicon Valley and the Environmental Inequalities of High-Tech Urbanism</a></em>, is published with the University of Oklahoma Press (2024).</li><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://www.historians.org/perspectives-article/spoiled-fruits-environmental-inequality-in-silicon-valley-november-2023/>Spoiled Fruits: Environmental Inequality in Silicon Valley</a>,&rdquo; <em>AHA Perspectives</em>, November 15, 2023.</li><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/04/26/how-silicon-valley-provides-blueprint-cleaning-up-our-drinking-water/>How Silicon Valley provides the blueprint for cleaning up our drinking water</a>&rdquo;, <em>The Washington Post</em>, April 26, 2019.</li><li>&ldquo;<a href=https://theconversation.com/how-silicon-valley-industry-polluted-the-sylvan-california-dream-85810>How Silicon Valley industry polluted the sylvan California dream</a>&rdquo;, <em>The Conversation</em>, November 15, 2017.</li><li>&ldquo;Green Dreams, Toxic Legacies: Toward a Digital Political Ecology of Silicon Valley,&rdquo; <em>International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing</em>, vol. 11, no. 1 (68-85), DOI: <a href=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/ijhac.2017.0179>10.3366/ijhac.2017.0179</a>.</li></ul><h1 id=news-and-updates>News and Updates</h1><p>This project is under version control.
