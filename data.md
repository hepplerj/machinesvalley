I am happy to share my data and the tools I have compiled or created with
other researchers. All of the resources here are free and available for use.

### Maps and GIS

- **[Santa Clara open space GeoJSON](https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley/tree/gh-pages/data-files/ca-openspace/openspace_santaclara.json)**: Based on data provied by the Bay Area Open Space Conservancy.
- **[California counties](https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley/tree/gh-pages/data-files/ca-counties/ca_counties.json)**: The California Bay Area counties GeoJSON file is used as a base map of some of the visualizations.
- **[Bay Area urban areas](https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley/tree/gh-pages/data-files/sv-urban/urban_areas_out.json)**: A GeoJSON file of the Bay Area's 2014 urban areas.
