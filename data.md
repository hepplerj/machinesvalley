## {{ page.title }}

I am happy to share my data and the tools I have compiled or created with 
other scholars. All of the resources here are free and available for use.

### Maps and GIS

- **[San Jose annexations shapefile]()**: Using the data [provided by the City of 
San Jose](), I restructured the shapefile into a yearly breakdown in order to 
build the [annexation visualization](). 
- **Open space shapefile** (coming soon): Based on my research and data provided by the Bay 
Area Open Space Conservancy, I added new information to the GIS files that 
includes the overseer of open space and the date of open space 
establishment.
- **Open space GeoJSON** (coming soon): The GIS shapefile above converted to a 
GeoJSON file.
- **[California counties]()**: The California Bay Area counties GeoJSON file is 
used as a base map of some of the visualizations. 
- **[Bay Area urban areas]()**: A GeoJSON file of the Bay Area's 2014 urban areas.

### Databases

- **[Silicon Valley companies, 1945-1990]()**: A database I am compiling of 
historical technology companies in the Bay Area.
- **[Bay Area Superfund sites]()**: A database of the regions's Superfund sites.
- **[Bay Area toxic sites]()**: A database of the region'ss toxic and spill sites.
