      <h3>About the Map</h3>

      <p>
      A persistent environmental critique of the Bay Area was the region's 
      growing traffic problems, which not only caused heavy congestion but 
      promoted smog that obscured the Valley's prized views. In 1958, the 
      Santa Clara County Planning Commission reported on journey-to-work 
      problems on the San Francisco Peninsula.

      <p>
      The visualization begins to confirm the argument&#8212;mine and
      others&#8212;that there existed an imbalance between the places people lived
      and the places people worked. These places were defined by city
      policies. Specifically, the visualization reflects a heavy concentration
      of commuters leaving San Jose for other parts of the Bay Area for their
      jobs.
