      <p>In the postwar era, San Jose undertook an aggressive annexation campaign
      to fold surrounding land and cities into its orbit.
      The expansion of San Jose followed from a desire among business leaders, civic leaders, and boosters to improve the city's reputation as well as capture a larger tax base. Reform politicians in the 1940s maintained a belief in the idea that metropolitan growth equaled progress. In San Jose, those candidates formed the Progressive Committee and ousted the city manager, police and fire chiefs, and political bosses from the city's leadership. By the end of the 1940s, Progress Committee candidates and their ideology of growth was fully entrenched in city politics.
      </p>

      <p>
      Growth, however, required funds&#8212;and city residents were rarely willing to allow new property taxes to help fund San Jose's need for new infrastructure. Bond elections throughout the 1940s were repeatedly voted down by residents. City leaders needed a new voice to help convince voters of the need for new taxes, and they found their champion in Anthony "Dutch" Hamann. The forty-year-old former businessman, teacher, and oil company representative had a strong attachment to the city and solid connections throughout the community.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Hamann had not served in political office until his appointment by the city council in 1950 in a split 4-to-3 vote. As the city began its drive for urban growth, Hamann hoped to avoid the fate that had befallen his home of Orange County in Southern California with its many competing medium-sized cities. Hamann believed that a large city could better manage urban development and growth than several small towns all looking out for their own interests. He wanted San Jose to dominate the county, and thus avoid what he saw as petty competition among small towns.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To grow and make available the funds to sustain growth, Hamann reasoned, the city needed to annex land to raise revenue from taxes.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> "You don't build a city by staying in a vacuum," Hamann declared. "You build, you sell. . . . And I was the gun for hire."<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
      And build San Jose did. The city approved over 1,400 annexations between 1945
and 1970 including many narrow strips&#8212;"shoestring" annexations&#8212;snaking outward,
sometimes only on one half of a street, to capture a desirable subdivision, commercial
center, or street intersection. In some areas, annexations became a tool of coercion. Annex enough areas around land-owning hold-outs, city officials reasoned, and pockets of non-annexed land would have little choice but to succumb.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Hamann's drive for land became so aggressive that his staff became known as "Dutch's Panzer division"&#8212;named after the swift motorized armored tank squadrons of the Third Reich&#8212;as annexations sprawled outward from the city core.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> "They say San Jose is going to become another Los Angeles," Hamann rebuked his critics. "Believe me, I'm going to do the best in my power to make that come true."<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Under Hamann's tenure, the San Jose Chamber of Commerce spent nearly $1 million to attract new industries to the city. The population boomed and the city sprawled. "It was just growth, growth, growth," Al Ruffo, San Jose's mayor in the 1940s, recalled approvingly. "That was everybody's song. And Dutch sang it the loudest."<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>
