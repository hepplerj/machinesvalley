      <h3>About the Visualization</h3>

      <p>
      The nine-county Bay Area underwent rapid population growth after World War II. Santa Clara County led the region in growth, in part because of efforts among municipalities to expand their size. The growth-as-progress contingent in city government led municipal political efforts at expansion, believing that the growth of their cities not only served the region better&#8212;avoiding what the saw as petty bickering among many small communities&#8212;but also served their interests by capturing a larger tax base and, in turn, fueling more efforts towards residential and industrial growth. The traditional urban centers of the Bay Area&#8212;San Francisco, Oakland, and Richmond&#8212;had seen their populations rise during the war years, but in the postwar era populations moved into the suburbs. Throughout the 1940s the population of Santa Clara County nearly doubled, and by the mid-1950s, nearly 4,000 new people were moving to the county every month. The county’s 1950 population of 290,547 people exploded to 642,365 by 1960, surpassing San Francisco as the region’s urban center.

      The rapid rise of the Bay Area followed a wartime and postwar trend throughout the American West. New opportunities in western cities after a decade of economic depression led migrants to metropolitan areas to take jobs in wartime industries in the 1940s. The American West especially felt the impact of this shift, leading urban historian Carl Abbott to remark that the migration led "the entire West into a half-century of head-long urbanization."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Western metropolitan areas&#8212;Dallas, San Francisco, San Jose, Denver, Albuquerque&#8212;became centers of new economies based on high technology, services, tourism, and recreation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The region that Bernard DeVoto once described as a "plundered province" had become an economic pacesetter in the latter twentieth century, propelled by world war, new economic pursuits, demographic shifts, and federal funding.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
